                    <h3>The What and the Why</h3>
                    <p>I have been on this career-switching journey since mid-2018 and there is a mountain of data on every topic. The process of finding the topic you want to study and then finding a source for quality information can be a learning process in itself. I hope this page will ease the early struggle by laying out a starting point for several topics which I have covered in my journey.</p>
                    <h3>A Few Helpful Hints</h3>
                    <p>Most of the information you find on the internet is easy to copy and paste into your editor. Resist this temptation and take the time to type in every character as you learn. This is an essential part of training your fingers and brain to do the work with less thought. There will be plenty of time later to utilize copy and paste but for now, focus on spending the time needed to really grasp what is happening.</p>
                    <p>Along the way you will get frustrated, things will get hard, you may want to cry. When you hit these roadblocks take a moment, a day, or a weekend and give yourself a break. I have lost track of the number of times I spend hours looking for a bug in the early learning stages and after finally giving up and going to sleep I found the bug within minutes of waking up. If something easy has become hard then its time to give yourself a rest.</p>
                    <p>Nobody in this field knows everything about anything and the most important skill is to be able to find the answer you need on the internet. I am a professional googler and you should be too.</p>
                    <h3>A Final Note</h3>
                    <p>All of the resources on this page are created by other people and so over time I expect that some will become out of date in some way. If you come across something that is no longer working please let me know so I can remove the tutorial or add a note to clarify the new process needed.</p>
